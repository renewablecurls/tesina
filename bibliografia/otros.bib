@article{LeMagorou2002,
abstract = {This study deals with the characterisation of wood-based panels (e.g. plywood, OSB, etc). Rigorous determination of their elastic and viscoelastic mechanical characteristics is necessary for reducing the safety factors used for technical applications of panels. For anisotropic panels, all bending/torsion rigidities have to be known. By contrast with the classic methods, which consist of directly identifying them one with one by several tests, the aim of this work is to allow the simultaneous identification of the bending/torsion rigidities by the resolution of an inverse problem. We associate optimised tests and an experimental method based on an original bending frame and optical metrology. Here are the first results. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
